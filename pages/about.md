This site is hosted on Github.

For me, the painful aspects of making a website are

*  Working with html and css
*  Finding a hosting site
*  Transferring stuff to the hosting site

With [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), you just write things in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
[GitHub](http://github.com) hosts the site for you, and you just push
material to your GitHub repository with `git add`, `git commit`, and
`git push`.
