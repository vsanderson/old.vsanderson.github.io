This site is under construction.... I'm a software developer for higher ed, and teach occasionally as well.
The best way to contact me is by [email](mailto:valeriananderson@gmail.com)

My current passion is coding in Clojure. I also enjoy developing web
applications in Ruby, and past projects have included progamming with
PHP, Java and Python.
